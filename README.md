# Cryptography-Basics

This C code is a menu driven program. After successful compilation and execution of the program,the program prompts the user to enter ‘1’ from keyboard to
encrypt the message, ‘2’ for decryption of the codes and ‘3’ for both encryption and decryption of the message simultaneously by generating encrypted
code numbers simultaneously. After selecting ‘1’ or ’3’ the computer encrypt the codes by selecting two prime numbers from the 'primes.txt' file which are generated by the 'primeGeneration.c' file.
The program exits when the user gives ‘0’ and prompts the user to give a valid choice if the user gives a value other than ‘1’ ,’2’ , ’3’ and ‘0’.
The encrypted codes are written to a file named ‘encrypted_codes.txt’ and the random private key ‘k’ genearated is written to a file named
‘private_key.txt’ each time an encryption is done.If the above files are not present in the directory before decryption of a message, the program
terminates generating an ‘ERROR’ message.After 3 unsuccessful attempts of decrypting the message, the 'encrypted_codes.txt' and 'private_key.txt' file will be deleted and hence the hidden message.Only the person knowing the
private key can decrypt the given message.
